# Rock-Paper-Scissors-HCJs-
This is a basic rock paper scissors game developed by me (Pawan) and my partner(Riya) using HTML, CSS and JS.
Some features like score board are yet to be added. 
The structure of this app is very simple consisting of a index.html file for the strucure and base, css for styling and Javascript for logic.
The images used are in jpg format and will be converted in the webp format later, for better performance.
